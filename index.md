## About Me

Hello there!

I am Matteo, I am from Italy, born and raised in Rome, now living in Brighton in England's south-east coast. Most of the time I am a videogame programmer.

Since very young I have always found computers fascinating, videogames in particular, wondering about who were the creators of those incredibly beautiful pieces of art like Tetris, Pong, Prince of Persia, Donkey Kong, Street Fighter, Metal Gear Solid and the list goes on and on. Hence, I enrolled in a Computer Engineering university course in the University of Roma Tre, where I obtained a bachelor and a Master of Science degrees, specialising in Graphic Rendering. During that time I had a fantastic experience studying for one year in the University of Glasgow as part of my Erasmus exchange scolarship. Afterwards, with the objective of focusing on videogames, I have applied and won a scolarship for a MSc in Computer Games Technology in Abertay University in Dundee, where I graduated with distinction.

After finishing my studies, I was lucky enough to land a job in NaturalMotion's Boss Alien studio in Brighton, and I could not have entered the game industry in a better place. At Boss Alien I was part of the development team behind hit mobile games such as CSR Racing and CSR Classics, as well as part of other yet unreleased projects. Curently, I work at King London studio, where I have been involved with different projects and worked in some of their multimillion dollars live titles, like Farm Heroes and Farm Heroes Super Saga, as well as participating in the development of shared libraries and engine middleware solving common technical challenges and running functional programming courses and workshops.

When I am not creating or playing videogames, researching functional programming or working on my own projects, you can find me kitesurfing in Camber Sands, riding my Triumph Bonneville T120 or travelling somewhere around the world! Or eating pizza üçï
